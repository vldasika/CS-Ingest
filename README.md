The Clearsense Data Management Platform is a secure and scalable platform that ingests, aggregates, and manages data allowing users to consume and use the data to make informed real-time decisions. With the ability to leverage data from disparate systems across the organization, Clearsense's data-first approach eliminates assumptions and replaces them with a single source of trusted data. 

Finally, you can trust your data!
